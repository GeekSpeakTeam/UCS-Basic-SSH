# UCS-Basic-SSH
Basic SSH script to execute commands from Python on UCS - Very basic
These scripts were set up as something to basically power on a UCS (220M4) and power it off.  
The intention for these scripts are to turn off and on a ESXI server so the host is only available for the time I need it and not burning power in the evening.
My Cisco Router running GuestShell will run scripts
The VM's will be configured to use Autostart on power
